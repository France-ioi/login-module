5.4 -> 5.5
The request helper will no longer retrieve nested keys. If needed, you may use the input method of the request to achieve this behavior:
return request()->input('filters.date');



As of Laravel 5.8, multi-word model names ending in a word with an irregular plural are now correctly pluralized.
// Laravel 5.7...
App\Feedback.php -> feedback (correctly pluralized)
App\UserFeedback.php -> user_feedbacks (incorrectly pluralized)
// Laravel 5.8
App\Feedback.php -> feedback (correctly pluralized)
App\UserFeedback.php -> user_feedback (correctly pluralized)
If you have a model that was incorrectly pluralized, you may continue using the old table name by defining a $table property on your model:

protected $table = 'user_feedbacks';
